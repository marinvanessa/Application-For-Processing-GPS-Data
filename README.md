[Short Dataset Description] This GPS trajectory dataset was collected in (Microsoft Research) Geolife project by 178 users in a period of over four years (from April 2007 to October 2011). A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of time-stamped points, each of which contains the information of latitude, longitude and altitude. 

## Data Visualization

This Python script **DataPreprocessing** reads location trajectory data from ".plt" files within a dataset containing 181 folders. It defines functions for reading and visualizing the trajectory, iterates through the dataset, and extracts trajectory data from the first ".plt" file encountered in each subfolder. The trajectory visualization function is included but commented out.
